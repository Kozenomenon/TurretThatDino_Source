Simple, stackable (green) mod - No Remaps!
Does not include any custom dinos. 
Does not include any custom items or structures. 

[b]What Does It Do?[/b]
This mod makes Noglins and Cnidaria targetable by -all- turrets. 
[i]Vanilla variants will also be affected by default.[/i]
That's it. 
Your turrets will see them and they will shoot them. 
Auto-Turrets, Heavy Turrets, Plant X Turrets, Modded Turrets. 
If its a turret, it will work. 

[i]NOTE: Generally, turrets need to be underwater in order to target dinos that are underwater- such as Cnidaria.[/i]

[b]But Koz- what about my modded Noglin or Cnidaria???[/b]
I included config settings for you folks using custom dino mods. 
You can put their spawn paths in the mod settings and it will work for them too.
