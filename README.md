## Setup
 _I recommend you add this to your Ark Dev Kit while it is closed._
 
 You will notice that this repo has some folders in it. 
 
 They must be copied to the precise locations specified! 
 - `ModBase` must go to your kit's `Content` folder. 
   - e.g. `ARKDevKit\Projects\ShooterGame\Content\ModBase` 
 - `Mods\TurretThatDino` must go to your kit's `Content\Mods` folder. 
   - e.g. `ARKDevKit\Projects\ShooterGame\Content\Mods\TurretThatDino` 
 - `media` doesn't go to your kit. 
 
 _Note: Yes, ModBase lives outside Mods folder._
