## Setup
 _I recommend you add this to your Ark Dev Kit while it is closed._
 You will notice that this repo has some folders in it. 
 They must be copied to the precise locations specified! 
 - `ModBase` must go to your kit's `Content` folder. 
   - eg. `ARKDevKit\Projects\ShooterGame\Content\ModBase`
